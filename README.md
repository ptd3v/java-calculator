# java-calculator
A basic calculator application made in Java. It takes two numbers, an operator and computes it. For example, 1 and 2 with the addition operator is 1 + 2 = 3.
The program is well commented and should be straight forward to understand, but let me know if you have any questions.

Bug Notes:
Whilst the application will work find on it's own, there are a lack of error messages for more advanced use and it cannot handle large numbers.
For testing purposes, I got to 1,000,000,000 before it starts to act up. Will probably expand on this at a later point.
